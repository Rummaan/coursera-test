	<h1>CINEMA</h1>
	<div>
		<p id="p1">
		Cinema is very common in India. Everyone is entertained by cinema and enjoys it for nearly three hours. Cinema came into existence in 1930. At first silent and black & white movies were made. After that coloured movies were made. Seeing a movie is not at all costly as compared to the other sources of entertainment. That is why everyone likes to see a film in a cinema hall.
		</p>
		<p id="p2"> Cinema has its merits and demerits too. If a person sees a bad film then he can adopt all the bad points of the film. To see too much of films can spoil our eyesight, waste our money, time and energy. A person who beÂ­comes a film fan wants to see every film at any cost, which is not at all good. Now-a-days cinema has become very popular and it is a good source of entertainment
